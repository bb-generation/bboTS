If you want to make changes to bboTS, just do it. There are currently no style guidelines. But keep in mind, that if your code gets integrated into the main-line, I will probably make style changes, so it fits into the rest of it.

If you think your changes may interest others, please create a new Issue at github (https://github.com/bb-generation/bboTS/issues) and attach your patch to it (git diff)


Short HowTo on how to get involved
==================================
At first clone the original git project:
    git clone git://github.com/bb-generation/bboTS.git

Then create a new branch
    git checkout -b my_new_branch

Now do some work.
Then make a commit (you can make as many commits as you want)
    git commit -am "Fixed bug xyz."

Now create a patch
    git format-patch master --stdout > my_new_branch.patch

After that go to https://gist.github.com/ and upload your my_new_branch.patch
Finally you can visit https://github.com/bb-generation/bboTS/issues and create
a new Issue containing a link to your uploaded file as seen above.
